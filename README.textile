I've been using This Dropbox Slideshow Thing for a while now to quickly put together images into a slideshow that I need to share with clients. I've thrown this up on Github in the hope that if there's anyone who find this useful or likes the concept can go ahead and fork and improve on it. Pull Requests and Issues are greatly appreciated.
